Naturaliefs is planning to develop a wallet and debit card to hold multiple crypto and fiat currencies. The two will be linked 
and allow payments by converting NMR or other Tokens to fiat currency at POS or simply pay with any crypto tokens if accepted. 
This will benefit marijuana businesses in particular due to the current traditional banking issues they face as they will be able 
to store payments and funds in the wallet. This is a complicated project and will require substantial time and resources.
<p>Approximately 18 months after beginning operations we are planning to offer franchising opportunities. For those interested, 
NMR Token holders will also be able to use NMR Tokens for a discount on the franchising fee.

It is our mission to produce the highest possible quality organic medical cannabis products at highly competitive prices. Our 
organic products will provide the necessary physical and mental relief without having to rely on possibly contaminated products 
that can end up doing far more harm than good. There are many low quality contaminated products containing harmful fertilizers and 
pesticides produced by those simply looking to profit from cannabis and those who rely on it 
for relief.
